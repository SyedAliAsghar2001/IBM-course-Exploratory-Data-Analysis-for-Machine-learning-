Objective: To identify the primary drivers behind hotel booking cancellations and provide data-driven insights to improve revenue management.

The Problem: A high volume of booking cancellations leads to significant revenue loss and operational inefficiencies for hotels. Understanding the root causes is the first step to mitigating them.

Approach: I performed an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of 119,000 hotel bookings. The process involved:

1. Cleaning the data and engineering new features for analysis.
2. Visualizing trends across guest demographics, timing, and booking channels.
3. Statistically testing key hypotheses to confirm their impact on cancellations.

Key Findings:

1. Lead Time is Key: Bookings made further in advance are significantly more likely to be canceled.
2. Seasonality Matters: Cancellation rates fluctuate significantly throughout the year, with distinct peaks and troughs.
3. Segment Risk: Certain market segments, like 'Groups', have a much higher propensity to cancel than others.
4. Overall Rate: The analysis confirmed a high cancellation rate of 37%, underscoring the importance of this issue.

Conclusion: This analysis pinpointed critical factors influencing cancellations, providing a foundation for targeted strategies such as adaptive deposit policies and tailored marketing to reduce financial loss and stabilize revenue.
